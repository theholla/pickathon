## Festival Background ##
[Pickathon](https://pickathon.com/info/) is an independent music festival that happens every summer at Pendarvis Farm near Portland, OR. The festival is a world leader in sustainable festival practices. One of its innovations was eliminating the trash created by single-use dishware by introducing a reusable cup/bowl/fork token system. It also encourages sustainable transport to and from the festival by being located right off a multiuse path, and encouraging people to attend via free shuttle to/from the city. Pickathon has a strong volunteer culture, and according to its website nearly 1500 people volunteer each year.
