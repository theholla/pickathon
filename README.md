# Pickathon Quick Schedule Explorer

As Pickathon enthusiasts, we were inspired to create this unofficial quick schedule explorer when we noticed slow load times on the festival website. After work the week before the festival, we created a super-simple, quick loading website designed for use offline on mobile phones. We wanted to be able to quickly find out what band to see and where, and then get off our phones to enjoy the festival.

## Festival Background ##
[Pickathon](https://pickathon.com/info/) is an independent music festival that happens every summer at Pendarvis Farm near Portland, OR. The festival is a world leader in sustainable festival practices. One of its innovations was eliminating the trash created by single-use dishware by introducing a reusable cup/bowl/fork token system. It also encourages sustainable transport to and from the festival by being located right off a multiuse path, and encouraging people to attend via free shuttle to/from the city. Pickathon has a strong volunteer culture, and according to its website nearly 1500 people volunteer each year.
